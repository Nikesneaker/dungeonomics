## Dungeonomics

A web-based organizational tool for Dungeon Masters that play Dungeons & Dragons. Dungeonomics allows DMs to create campaigns and link monsters and NPCs to their campaigns for easy access and readability.

## Motivation

Dungeonomics was created in an attempt to get rid of piles of papers that DMs have to manage when creating and maintaining a D&D campaign. We want to remove the process of focusing on a campaign, flipping to a monster stat-line to control a combat, flipping back to the campaign, interacting with players and constantly referencing or searching for different papers... It's all gone with Dungeonomics. Everything is on one computer screen, with quick access to assets like monsters and NPCs without losing focus on the main campaign.
